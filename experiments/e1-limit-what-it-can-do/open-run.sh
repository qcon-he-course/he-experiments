# Experiment 1, right window: plain Claude Code on a fresh clone of seeded PetClinic.
# Start ./tripwire.sh in another window first.
#
# Interactive by default: you trust the folder, paste the questions, /exit.
# E1_BATCH=1 runs unattended with claude -p and the six questions (the ladder's
# batch.sh does this for "e1"): it starts the tripwire if it isn't running, and
# stops it again afterwards if it started it. Unattended runs use Claude Code's
# dontAsk permission mode, as experiment 0's do, so the stored open and
# contained runs differ only in the floor. Interactive runs keep the default
# mode: the presenter answers each prompt. An unattended run is stopped after
# E1_TIME_CAP seconds.
#
# Each run is saved in runs/<date-time>-<model>/ (git-ignored):
#   config/        Claude Code's state for the run, including the session transcript
#   tripwire.log   what the tripwire received during the run
#   git-status.txt the clone's state when Claude Code exited
#   trial.patch    the patch applied, when E1_PATCH was set
#   prompt.txt, answer.txt, stderr.txt   in unattended runs
#   timed-out.txt  if an unattended run was stopped at the time cap
#
# The PetClinic clone the agent works on lives outside the course project, in
# E1_WORKDIR, and is removed when the run ends; E1_KEEP_CLONE=1 keeps it. Seeded
# repositories carry the rigged payloads, so they stay out of the project.
#
# Settings are in settings.sh. E1_PATCH=<file> applies a patch from trials/ to the
# clone and folds it into the seeding commit, to try a change before seeding it.
# E1_NO_CACHE=1 switches prompt caching off for the run (DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING),
# so every request is billed as fresh input: costlier, and counted against your plan.
